When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
You would want to use a remote repository, if you were working with a non-local group. For example, collaborating on open-source software with foreigners. 
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
There may be a change that you do not wish others to know about before publishing the changes.
